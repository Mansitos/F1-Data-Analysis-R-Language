# A journey through 71 years of Formula 1

### University Project. Course: Advanced Data Science 2020 (UNIUD)
Exam mark/score: 30L (max)

The HTML file you have to check:  **A journey through 71 years of Formula 1 _ Final Report.html**

**What you can find here:**
- An HTML report about the last 71 years of F1 (the result of the project, what you should check!)
- R + Rmd code about the analysis (first part: code and tests, second part: report)
- The report is the HTML file, open it with your browser
- The code is public, the dataset too (available on kaggle.com, link in the introduction)
- Code is partially commented in italian... the report is in english as required by the course
- lot of bugs and unclear code :P

(Actually my first data science project: I'm very proud of it!)

A render of the HTML report (png animations are lost...) I still recommend downloading the html file.
